QUESTION NO: 2
For a machine learning progress, how should you split data for training and evaluation?
A. Use features for training and labels for evaluation.
B. Randomly split the data into rows for training and rows for evaluation.
C. Use labels for training and features for evaluation.
D. Randomly split the data into columns for training and columns for evaluation.
Answer: B
Explanation:
The Split Data module is particularly useful when you need to separate data into training and
testing sets. Use the Split Rows option if you want to divide the data into two parts. You can
specify the percentage of data to put in each split, but by default, the data is divided 50-50. You
can also randomize the selection of rows in each group, and use stratified sampling.

Explanation:
Box 1: 11
TP = True Positive.
The class labels in the training set can take on only two possible values, which we usually refer
to as positive or negative. The positive and negative instances that a classifier predicts correctly
are called true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN), respectively. Similarly, the incorrectly
classified instances are called false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN).
Box 2: 1,033
FN = False Negative

QUESTION NO: 4
You build a machine learning model by using the automated machine learning user interface
(UI).
You need to ensure that the model meets the Microsoft transparency principle for responsible AI.
What should you do?
A. Set Validation type to Auto.
B. Enable Explain best model.
C. Set Primary metric to accuracy.
D. Set Max concurrent iterations to 0.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Model Explain Ability.
Most businesses run on trust and being able to open the ML “black box” helps build
transparency and trust. In heavily regulated industries like healthcare and banking, it is critical
to comply with regulations and best practices. One key aspect of this is understanding the
relationship between input variables (features) and model output. Knowing both the magnitude
and direction of the impact each feature (feature importance) has on the predicted value helps
better understand and explain the model. With model explain ability, we enable you to
understand feature importance as part of automated ML runs.

Explanation:
Reliability and safety:
AI systems need to be reliable and safe in order to be trusted. It is important for a system to
perform as it was originally designed and for it to respond safely to new situations. Its inherent
resilience should resist intended or unintended manipulation. Rigorous testing and validation
should be established for operating conditions to ensure that the system responds safely to edge
cases, and A/B testing and champion/challenger methods should be integrated into the evaluation
process.
An AI system's performance can degrade over time, so a robust monitoring and model tracking
process needs to be established to reactively and proactively measure the model's performance
and retrain it, as necessary, to modernize it.

This is an example of which Microsoft guiding principle for responsible AI?
A. fairness
B. inclusiveness
C. reliability and safety
D. accountability
Answer: B
Explanation:

Explanation:
Box 1: Reliability and safety
To build trust, it's critical that AI systems operate reliably, safely, and consistently under normal
circumstances and in unexpected conditions. These systems should be able to operate as they
were originally designed, respond safely to unanticipated conditions, and resist harmful
manipulation.
Box 2: Accountability
The people who design and deploy AI systems must be accountable for how their systems
operate. Organizations should draw upon industry standards to develop accountability norms.
These norms can ensure that AI systems are not the final authority on any decision that impacts
people's lives and that humans maintain meaningful control over otherwise highly autonomous
AI systems.
Box 3: Privacy and security
As AI becomes more prevalent, protecting privacy and securing important personal and business
information is becoming more critical and complex. With AI, privacy and data security issues
require especially close attention because access to data is essential for AI systems to make
accurate and informed predictions and decisions about people. AI systems must comply with
privacy laws that require transparency about the collection, use, and storage of data and mandate
that consumers have appropriate controls to choose how their data is used

QUESTION NO: 18
When you design an AI system to assess whether loans should be approved, the factors used to
make the decision should be explainable.
This is an example of which Microsoft guiding principle for responsible AI?
A. transparency
B. inclusiveness
C. fairness
D. privacy and security
Answer: A
Explanation:
Achieving transparency helps the team to understand the data and algorithms used to train the
model, what transformation logic was applied to the data, the final model generated, and its
associated assets. This information offers insights about how the model was created, which
allows it to be reproduced in a transparent way.
Incorrect Answers:
B: Inclusiveness mandates that AI should consider all human races and experiences, and
inclusive design practices can help developers to understand and address potential barriers that
could unintentionally exclude people. Where possible, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and visual
recognition technology should be used to empower people with hearing, visual, and other
impairments.
C: Fairness is a core ethical principle that all humans aim to understand and apply. This principle
is even more important when AI systems are being developed. Key checks and balances need to
make sure that the system's decisions don't discriminate or run a gender, race, sexual orientation,
or religion bias toward a group or individual.
D: A data holder is obligated to protect the data in an AI system, and privacy and security are an
integral part of this system. Personal needs to be secured, and it should be accessed in a way that
doesn't compromise an individual's privacy.

Explanation:
Box 1: Model evaluation
The Model evaluation module outputs a confusion matrix showing the number of true positives,
false negatives, false positives, and true negatives, as well as ROC, Precision/Recall, and Lift
curves.
Box 2: Feature engineering
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that
help ML algorithms learn better. In Azure Machine Learning, scaling and normalization
techniques are applied to facilitate feature engineering. Collectively, these techniques and feature
engineering are referred to as featurization.
Note: Often, features are created from raw data through a process of feature engineering. For
example, a time stamp in itself might not be useful for modeling until the information is
transformed into units of days, months, or categories that are relevant to the problem, such as
holiday versus working day.
Box 3: Feature selection
In machine learning and statistics, feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of
relevant, useful features to use in building an analytical model. Feature selection helps narrow
the field of data to the most valuable inputs. Narrowing the field of data helps reduce noise and
improve training performance.

You have the Predicted vs. True chart shown in the following exhibit.
Which type of model is the chart used to evaluate?
A. classification
B. regression
C. clustering
Answer: B
Explanation:
What is a Predicted vs. True chart?
Predicted vs. True shows the relationship between a predicted value and its correlating true value
for a regression problem. This graph can be used to measure performance of a model as the
closer to the y=x line the predicted values are, the better the accuracy of a predictive model.

Which type of machine learning should you use to predict the number of gift cards that will be
sold next month?
A. classification
B. regression
C. clustering
Answer: B
Explanation:
In the most basic sense, regression refers to prediction of a numeric target.
Linear regression attempts to establish a linear relationship between one or more independent
variables and a numeric outcome, or dependent variable.
You use this module to define a linear regression method, and then train a model using a labeled
dataset. The trained model can then be used to make predictions.

QUESTION NO: 37
You have a dataset that contains information about taxi journeys that occurred during a given
period.
You need to train a model to predict the fare of a taxi journey.
What should you use as a feature?
A. the number of taxi journeys in the dataset
B. the trip distance of individual taxi journeys
C. the fare of individual taxi journeys
D. the trip ID of individual taxi journeys
Answer: B
Explanation:
The label is the column you want to predict. The identified Features are the inputs you give the
model to predict the Label.
Example:
The provided data set contains the following columns:
vendor_id: The ID of the taxi vendor is a feature.
rate_code: The rate type of the taxi trip is a feature.
passenger_count: The number of passengers on the trip is a feature.
trip_time_in_secs: The amount of time the trip took. You want to predict the fare of the trip
before the trip is completed. At that moment, you don't know how long the trip would take. Thus,
the trip time is not a feature and you'll exclude this column from the model.
trip_distance: The distance of the trip is a feature.
payment_type: The payment method (cash or credit card) is a feature.
fare_amount: The total taxi fare paid is the label.

Explanation:
Box 1: Yes
Automated machine learning, also referred to as automated ML or AutoML, is the process of
automating the time consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. It
allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency,
and productivity all while sustaining model quality.
Box 2: No
Box 3: Yes
During training, Azure Machine Learning creates a number of pipelines in parallel that try
different algorithms and parameters for you. The service iterates through ML algorithms paired
with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The higher
the score, the better the model is considered to "fit" your data. It will stop once it hits the exit
criteria defined in the experiment.
Box 4: No
Apply automated ML when you want Azure Machine Learning to train and tune a model for you
using the target metric you specify.
The label is the column you want to predict.

Explanation:
Box 1: Yes
In machine learning, if you have labeled data, that means your data is marked up, or annotated,
to show the target, which is the answer you want your machine learning model to predict.
In general, data labeling can refer to tasks that include data tagging, annotation, classification,
moderation, transcription, or processing.
Box 2: No
Box 3: No
Accuracy is simply the proportion of correctly classified instances. It is usually the first metric
you look at when evaluating a classifier. However, when the test data is unbalanced (where most
of the instances belong to one of the classes), or you are more interested in the performance on
either one of the classes, accuracy doesn't really capture the effectiveness of a classifier.

Explanation:
In the most basic sense, regression refers to prediction of a numeric target.
Linear regression attempts to establish a linear relationship between one or more independent
variables and a numeric outcome, or dependent variable.
You use this module to define a linear regression method, and then train a model using a labeled
dataset. The trained model can then be used to make predictions.
Incorrect Answers:
• Classification is a machine learning method that uses data to determine the category,
type, or class of an item or row of data.
• Clustering, in machine learning, is a method of grouping data points into similar clusters.
It is also called segmentation.
Over the years, many clustering algorithms have been developed. Almost all clustering
algorithms use the features of individual items to find similar items. For example, you might
apply clustering to find similar people by demographics. You might use clustering with text
analysis to group sentences with similar topics or sentiment.

A: R-squared (R2), or Coefficient of determination represents the predictive power of the model
as a value between -inf and 1.00. 1.00 means there is a perfect fit, and the fit can be arbitrarily
poor so the scores can be negative.
C: RMS-loss or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (also called Root Mean Square Deviation,
RMSD), measures the difference between values predicted by a model and the values observed
from the environment that is being modeled.
Incorrect Answers:
B: F1 score also known as balanced F-score or F-measure is used to evaluate a classification
model.
D: aucROC or area under the curve (AUC) is used to evaluate a classification model.

QUESTION NO: 63
Which metric can you use to evaluate a classification model?
A. true positive rate
B. mean absolute error (MAE)
C. coefficient of determination (R2)
D. root mean squared error (RMSE)
Answer: A
Explanation:
What does a good model look like?
An ROC curve that approaches the top left corner with 100% true positive rate and 0% false
positive rate will be the best model. A random model would display as a flat line from the
bottom left to the top right corner. Worse than random would dip below the y=x line.

Explanation:
Box 1: Regression
In the most basic sense, regression refers to prediction of a numeric target.
Linear regression attempts to establish a linear relationship between one or more independent
variables and a numeric outcome, or dependent variable.
You use this module to define a linear regression method, and then train a model using a labeled
dataset. The trained model can then be used to make predictions.
Box 2: Clustering
Clustering, in machine learning, is a method of grouping data points into similar clusters. It is
also called segmentation.
Over the years, many clustering algorithms have been developed. Almost all clustering
algorithms use the features of individual items to find similar items. For example, you might
apply clustering to find similar people by demographics. You might use clustering with text
analysis to group sentences with similar topics or sentiment.
Box 3: Classification
Two-class classification provides the answer to simple two-choice questions such as Yes/No or
True/False.

Explanation:
Box 1: Yes
For regression problems, the label column must contain numeric data that represents the
response variable. Ideally the numeric data represents a continuous scale.
Box 2: No
K-Means Clustering
Because the K-means algorithm is an unsupervised learning method, a label column is optional.
If your data includes a label, you can use the label values to guide selection of the clusters and
optimize the model.
If your data has no label, the algorithm creates clusters representing possible categories, based
solely on the data.
Box 3: No
For classification problems, the label column must contain either categorical values or discrete
values. Some examples might be a yes/no rating, a disease classification code or name, or an
income group. If you pick a noncategorical column, the component will return an error during
training.

transform, the data as needed.
2. Train model: Split the data into two groups, a training and a validation set. Train a
machine learning model using the training data set. Test the machine learning model for
performance using the validation data set.
3. Evaluate performance: Compare how close the model's predictions are to the known
labels.
4. Deploy a predictive service: After you train a machine learning model, you need to
convert the training pipeline into a real-time inference pipeline. Then you can deploy the
model as an application on a server or device so that others can use it.

Dependent variables
Different techniques of regression in azure machine learning.
One of the most very common techniques in regression is Linear Regression. The linear
regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and
one or more independent variables. For example, if you want to predict the house prices
(dependent variable) by using independent variables of house location, house size, the
relationship will be linear.

Note: Loan chargeoff prediction with SQL Server, example.
Solution details
A charged off loan is a loan that is declared by a creditor (usually a lending institution) that an
amount of debt is unlikely to be collected, usually when the loan repayment is severely
delinquent by the debtor. Given that high chargeoff has a negative impact on lending institutions’
year-end financials, lending institutions often monitor loan chargeoff risk very closely to prevent
loans from getting charged-off.
There are multiple benefits for lending institutions to equip with loan chargeoff prediction data.
Charging off a loan is the last resort that the bank will do on a severely delinquent loan, with the
prediction data at hand, the loan officer could offer personalized incentives like lower interest
rate or longer repayment period to help customers to keep making loan payments and thus
prevent the loan of getting charged off. To get to this type of prediction data, often credit unions
or banks manually handcraft the data based on customers' past payment history and performed
simple statistical regression analysis.

Explanation:
Box 1: Yes
Custom Vision functionality can be divided into two features. Image classification applies one or
more labels to an image. Object detection is similar, but it also returns the coordinates in the
image where the applied label(s) can be found.
Box 2: Yes
The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze images. You, the
developer, submit groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You
label the images yourself at the time of submission. Then, the algorithm trains to this data and
calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images.
Box 3: No
Custom Vision service can be used only on graphic files.

Explanation:
Box 1: Image classification
Image classification is a supervised learning problem: define a set of target classes (objects to
identify in images), and train a model to recognize them using labeled example photos.
Box 2: Object detection
Object detection is a computer vision problem. While closely related to image classification,
object detection performs image classification at a more granular scale. Object detection both
locates and categorizes entities within images.
Box 3: Semantic Segmentation
Semantic segmentation achieves fine-grained inference by making dense predictions inferring
labels for every pixel, so that each pixel is labeled with the class of its enclosing object ore
region.

You use drones to identify where weeds grow between rows of crops to send an instruction for
the removal of the weeds.
This is an example of which type of computer vision?
A. object detection
B. optical character recognition (OCR)
C. scene segmentation
Answer: A
Explanation:
Object detection is similar to tagging, but the API returns the bounding box coordinates for each
tag applied. For example, if an image contains a dog, cat and person, the Detect operation will
list those objects together with their coordinates in the image.
Incorrect Answers:
B: Optical character recognition (OCR) allows you to extract printed or handwritten text from

Explanation:
Box 1: Facial recognition
Face detection that perceives faces and attributes in an image; person identification that matches
an individual in your private repository of up to 1 million people; perceived emotion recognition
that detects a range of facial expressions like happiness, contempt, neutrality, and fear; and
recognition and grouping of similar faces in images.
Box 2: OCR
Box 3: Objection detection
Object detection is similar to tagging, but the API returns the bounding box coordinates (in
pixels) for each object found. For example, if an image contains a dog, cat and person, the Detect
operation will list those objects together with their coordinates in the image. You can use this
functionality to process the relationships between the objects in an image. It also lets you
determine whether there are multiple instances of the same tag in an image.
The Detect API applies tags based on the objects or living things identified in the image. There is
currently no formal relationship between the tagging taxonomy and the object detection
taxonomy. At a conceptual level, the Detect API only finds objects and living things, while the
Tag API can also include contextual terms like "indoor", which can't be localized with bounding
boxes.

Explanation:
Azure Custom Vision is a cognitive service that lets you build, deploy, and improve your own
image classifiers. An image classifier is an AI service that applies labels (which represent
classes) to images, according to their visual characteristics. Unlike the Computer Vision service,
Custom Vision allows you to specify the labels to apply.
Note: The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to apply labels to images.
You, the developer, must submit groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in
question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission. Then the algorithm trains to
this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images. Once the
algorithm is trained, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it to classify new images according
to the needs of your app. You can also export the model itself for offline use.

Explanation:
Box 1: verification
Identity verification
Modern enterprises and apps can use the Face identification and Face verification operations to
verify that a user is who they claim to be.
Box 2: similarity
The Find Similar operation does face matching between a target face and a set of candidate
faces, finding a smaller set of faces that look similar to the target face. This is useful for doing a
face search by image.
The service supports two working modes, matchPerson and matchFace. The matchPerson mode
returns similar faces after filtering for the same person by using the Verify API. The matchFace
mode ignores the same-person filter. It returns a list of similar candidate faces that may or may
not belong to the same person.
Box 3: identification
Face identification can address "one-to-many" matching of one face in an image to a set of faces
in a secure repository. Match candidates are returned based on how closely their face data
matches the query face. This scenario is used in granting building or airport access to a certain
group of people or verifying the user of a device.

Explanation:
Box 1: Yes
Image classification is a popular area of artificial intelligence. One application of image
classification that’s already being used in industry is the detection of quality issues on assembly
lines during manufacturing. In a typical production line, components travel down the assembly
line from one station to another, at the end of which an inspector steps in to look for problems—
a manual and error-prone process. AI-driven image classification reduces human effort and
automatically classifies images as pass or fail. This improves not only the efficiency of the
human operators in the validation process, but also the quality of the overall manufacturing
process.
Box 2: Yes
Object detection is similar to tagging, but the API returns the bounding box coordinates (in
pixels) for each object found in the image. For example, if an image contains a dog, cat and
person, the Detect operation will list those objects with their coordinates in the image. You can
use this functionality to process the relationships between the objects in an image. It also lets you
determine whether there are multiple instances of the same object in an image.

Box 1: Facial analysis.
In another change, we [Microsoft] will retire facial analysis capabilities that purport to infer
emotional states and identity attributes such as gender, age, smile, facial hair, hair, and makeup.
We collaborated with internal and external researchers to understand the limitations and potential
benefits of this technology and navigate the tradeoffs. In the case of emotion classification
specifically, these efforts raised important questions about privacy, the lack of consensus on a
definition of “emotions,” and the inability to generalize the linkage between facial expression
and emotional state across use cases, regions, and demographics. API access to capabilities that
predict sensitive attributes also opens up a wide range of ways they can be misused — including
subjecting people to stereotyping, discrimination, or unfair denial of services.

Box 1: detection.
Attributes are a set of features that can optionally be detected by the Face - Detect API. The
following attributes can be detected:
* Exposure. The exposure of the face in the image. This attribute returns a value between zero
and one and an informal rating of underExposure, goodExposure, or overExposure.
* Noise. The visual noise detected in the face image. This attribute returns a value between zero
and one and an informal rating of low, medium, or high.
* Occlusion. Whether there are objects blocking parts of the face. This attribute returns a
Boolean value for eyeOccluded, foreheadOccluded, and mouthOccluded.
* Etc.

QUESTION NO: 124
Your company manufactures widgets.
You have 1,000 digital photos of the widgets.
You need to identify the location of the widgets within the photos.
What should you use?
A. Computer Vision Spatial Analysis
B. Custom Vision object detection
C. Computer Vision Image Analysis
D. Custom Vision classification
Answer: B
Explanation:
Object detection is similar to tagging, but the API returns the bounding box coordinates (in
pixels) for each object found in the image. For example, if an image contains a dog, cat and
person, the Detect operation will list those objects with their coordinates in the image. You can
use this functionality to process the relationships between the objects in an image. It also lets you
determine whether there are multiple instances of the same object in an image.
The object detection function applies tags based on the objects or living things identified in the
image.
Incorrect:
* Computer Vision Spatial Analysis
Spatial analysis detects and locates human presence in video footage and outputs by using a
bounding box around a human body. The AI models don’t detect faces or determine individuals’
identities or demographics.

Do subsequent processing or searches. You can use NLP output for these purposes.
Summarize text by identifying the entities that are present in the document.
Tag documents with keywords. For the keywords, NLP can use identified entities.
Do content-based search and retrieval. Tagging makes this functionality possible.
Summarize a document's important topics. NLP can combine identified entities into topics.
Categorize documents for navigation. For this purpose, NLP uses detected topics.
Enumerate related documents based on a selected topic. For this purpose, NLP uses detected
topics.
Score text for sentiment. By using this functionality, you can assess the positive or negative tone
of a document.

Explanation:
Box 1: Speech
Custom Speech: Code-free automated machine learning for speech recognition
Speech to text is a Speech service feature that accurately transcribes spoken audio to text.
Make spoken audio actionable
Quickly and accurately transcribe audio to text in more than 100 languages and variants.
Customize models to enhance accuracy for domain-specific terminology. Get more value from
spoken audio by enabling search or analytics on transcribed text or facilitating action—all in
your preferred programming language.
Box 2: Language service
Add intents to your LUIS app to identify groups of questions or commands that have the same
intention.
Note: Language understanding (LU) is a very centric component to enable conversational
services such as bots, IoT experiences, analytics, and others. In a spoken dialog system, LU
converts from the words in a sentence into a machine-readable meaning representation, typically
indicating the intent of the sentence and any present entities. For example, consider a physical
fitness domain, with a dialog system embedded in a wearable device like a watch. This dialog
system could recognize intents like StartActivity and StopActivity, and could recognize entities
like ActivityType. In the user input “begin a jog”, the goal of LU is to identify the intent as
StartActivity, and identify the entity ActivityType= ’’jog’’.
Box 3: Language service
Intent compared to entity
The intent represents the action the application should take for the user, based on the entire
utterance. An utterance can have only one top-scoring intent, but it can have many entities.
Create an intent when the user's intention would trigger an action in your client application, like
a call to the checkweather() function from the table above. Then create entities to represent
parameters required to execute the action.
