dumps

got dumps from a guy from github, as this is only a pdf file, I have created a little program where you can inject the dump into in python.
it is "functional" and injests all with the right format - triger in the file needs to contain ""question no:" and triger for answers is "answer:"
it is a very simple GYI interface but still better than browsing in the PDF file.
happy coding folks
